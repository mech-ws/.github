![Zivid. See more. Do more. For Developers. By developers.][header-image]

**Welcome, fellow developer, weâ€™re happy to see you here! :tada:**

Zivid designs industrial 3D color cameras together with a high-quality 3D vision software development kit for demanding robotic
applications. **If your robot can see more, it can do more!**

Our products are built with the developer in mind, and we want to make sure you are able to get started as quickly as
possible with the Zivid SDK. We have created this page to introduce our software, answer any questions you might have,
and show some of the cool things you can do with Zivid.

Available for Windows and Linux, the Zivid SDK is a GPU-based framework that ensures scalable and fast 3D point cloud generation.
The SDK includes APIs for [C++, .NET](https://www.zivid.com/software/api-documentation) and [Python](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-python). We also support [ROS](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-ros) and have experimental support for Halcon via GenTL.
So, you can use the Zivid SDK in a multitude of languages immediately.

:rocket: **Drivers and packages**

Get the official drivers and software packages you need and start developing Zivid-based 3D machine vision applications
right away. Our software is composed of a Core API, Zivid Studio, command line tools and calibration tools.
